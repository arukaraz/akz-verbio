# Verbio
A tool that helps you memorize texts progressively by hiding words through levels. It starts with fully visible text, gradually removes words, and uses interactive exercises like guessing the first letter to reinforce memory. The app includes options to tailor your learning experience, adapting as you advance through levels.
